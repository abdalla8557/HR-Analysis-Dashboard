# HR-Analysis-Dashboard

I developed an interactive dashboard tailored for the HR department to monitor the workforce across the Middle East. Through my analysis of the employee data, I discovered that the Manufacturing department has the highest number of employees by a significant margin compared to other departments — which is expected, as it is the core and most essential department in our company.

I also found that the majority of the workforce is based in Egypt, and male employees represent a higher proportion than females in terms of labor distribution.

The number of employees steadily increased each year until 2020, when the company decided to reduce the workforce due to the global pandemic — COVID-19.

The dashboard includes slicers that allow users to filter and track employees by country and Center, offering a focused and detailed view of workforce distribution.
